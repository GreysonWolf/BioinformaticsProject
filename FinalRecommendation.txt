Final recommendation for grad student:
Proteomes 3,5,7,15,16,19,23,24,29,38,39,42,44,45,48,50 all have the mcrA gene present
Only proteomes 3, 42, 45, and 50  have more than 1 copy for the HSP70  gene (most pH resistant.) 
Because of this, we recommend that the student move forward with isolates 3, 42, 45, and 50
